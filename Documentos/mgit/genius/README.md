This bash script prints the current song lyrics using the Genius API.

To echo the lyrics, first the script clears the terminal, then prints the lyrics and waits until a new song is played. Again, the termial is cleared and the new lyrics echoed, in a continuous way.

The Genius API token must be saved in the file ~/.genius_token
